            <h1>Universal Coding Practices</h1>
            <p>
                Many languages have styling/organizational practices specific to them, sometimes created by an expert
                in that language, sometimes created and silently followed by the community that uses it.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="codeblock">
                <div class="codeblock-code">
                    <p>Python's PEP 8 standard is an example of a language whose creator made styling rules.</p>
                </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Whichever of these is true for the language that you are using, you should seek out guides for how to
                best
                format your code in whatever languages you are using. Outside of that however, there are still some
                universal
                rules that you can follow:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Be consistent with your spacing</h3>


                    <p>
                        Everyone has a preference for either spaces or tabs. Regardless of which one you steadfastly
                        refuse to accept, keep it consistent in your code. Switching between the two on a whim can
                        lead to malformed code and weird spacing issues.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Comment Thoroughly</h3>
                    <p>
                        Regardless of how ashamed you feel about every line of JS that you write, be sure to include
                        comments wherever something could be unclear. Sure, this helps developers that come after
                        you,
                        but it also benefits you when you need to work on source code that you haven't touched in a
                        while.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Keep you names consistent</h3>
                    <p>
                        It's tempting to name your classes/functions/variables on the fly, but when you try to reference
                        them
                        later you might regret it. It's important to stick to a naming structure across your project -
                        if you started out camel-casing variable names and capitalizing class names, make sure to keep
                        that
                        consistent throughout. Doing this provides people accessing your API with a sense of how your
                        code
                        functions and makes it easier to get familiar with.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote class="codeblock">
                        <div class="codeblock-code">
                            <p>Any languages specific conventions for naming your classes/variables should
                                supercede personal preference.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                    <h3>Example</h3>
                    <p>
                        Here's a great video from Computerphile (University of Nottingham) that demonstrates the
                        struggles of dealing with inconsistencies when you code:
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
