                In this section I'll talk about styling/naming conventions for specific languages. These practices are
                either created by an authority
                in the language, or broadly used by the community.

                Probably the most well-documented guide for Python style is <a
                    href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" target="_blank">PEP8</a>
                and is maintained by the Python Software Foundation (PSF).
            </p>
            <p>
                PEP8 was assembled from Python author Guido van Rossum's original style guide, with additions from other
                contributors. It
                represents probably the most comprehensive guide for core Python libraries, and is a good starting point
                for anyone
                trying to make their Python script readable.

            <p id="Java">
                With a language as accessible and easy to use as python, it can be tempting to just spit out code
                line-by-line without much
                thought, but after a while your code will get much longer and you'll thank yourself for organizing it.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="codeblock" cite="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">
                <p class="codeblock-code">One of Guido's key insights is that code is read much more often than it is
                    written.</p>

            <h1>Java</h1>
            <p>
                Java is a very strict language.  It's strongly typed and verbose.  This is why it's important to stick to good practices
                when coding in Java - it'll help you in Java even more than other languages. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Since Java is an object-oriented language, methods and fields derive from classes which inherit their parents, and so on.
                This can lead to very long calls, like: 
            </p>
            <blockquote class="codeblock" cite="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">
                <p class="codeblock-code">ReallyLongClassName.reallyLongVoidFunctionName().AnotherFunction(private_variable);</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                So, when coding in Java (and other C-based languages) it's very important to keep things like class and 
                function names organized.  In the example above, class names are capitalized, function names are camel-cased, 
                and member variable names are lowercased with underscores.  This isn't necessarily the way you should 
                organize your own code - but it's important to make a distinction between different component types 
                so that when you see that really long statement, you know what the parts are.

            <h1 id="JavaScript">JavaScript</h1>
            <p>
                JavaScript is an altogether different beast than a lot of other modern programming languages. There is a vast amount of popular libraries for JavaScript 
                that can turn it into virtually any kind of language. Vue, Node, React, Express, Electron are all popular libraries that 
                extend the functionality of JavaScript to the point where it's unlikely you will use core JS if you are developing in JavaScript.  
            </p>
            <p>
                With all these libraries, it can be hard to keep track of the right way to format your code.  It's generally best to follow the guidelines 
                that are outlined by the specific library that you're using.
