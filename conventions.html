            <h1>Coding Conventions</h1>
            <p>
                While every programmer has their own preferences when it comes to how their code should look, there are
                some dogmatic conventions
                that should sometimes take precedent over individual style - I would define these conventions
                as collections of styles and practices specific to a situation. Often these conventions are specific to
                a company, language,
                or codebase. As such I don't have many recommendations for those kinds of conventions to follow, but
                there are great books
                about different kinds of conventions that can be found on Amazon.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I can't touch on specific coding conventions, I can outline some elements of what I would call a
                universal convention.
                These are things that I believe to be constant across a lot of programming practices, styles and the
                like - and these are just some
                that I've picked up on, there are bound to be more.
            </p>
            <h1>Constants</h1>
            <p>
                Constants are variables whose values will not change over the course of a program's lifecycle, and
                should generally be declared in a file separate from the main functionality of your program. Most
                programmers will be able to
                recognize a variable as a constant if it is fully capitalized, for example:
                <code><i>MY_CONSTANT</i></code>.
            </p>
            <h1>Semicolons</h1>
            <p>
                Most object-oriented programming languages require the use of semicolons to indicate the end of a
                statement, and so many programmers
                recognize this as their purpose. Even in languages such as JavaScript, where semicolons aren't
                necessary, I've found that many
                people and websites still recommend their use to improve readability. So, I would say that if you are
                able to use semicolons in a
                language, do it.
