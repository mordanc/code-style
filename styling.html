            <h1>What is Code Styling?</h1>
            <p>
                Code style is all about the specifics of how your code is formatted. Conventions are
                broader and can encompass many styles, and can apply just to one languages. General styling
                principles, however, are usually more universal.
            </p>
            <p>
                If someone has a distinct coding style, it separates what their code looks like from
                others. For instance, one person may use tabs, comment extensively before each method,
                and have a certain way that they like to name all of their variables. These things combined
                make one programmer's style. Everyone has preferences when it comes to what conventions and
                practices they follow, and a lot of people will prefer different combinations of each, maybe
                even depending on the language.
            </p>

                While having a distinct style can help you get more comfortable with your own codebase, it's
                important that your own preferences don't make it difficult for other people to parse through
                - and that they are consistent. This can be the difference between someone being able to easily
                read through your code while recognizing your styilistic choices versus being completely at
                a loss as to what your code does.
